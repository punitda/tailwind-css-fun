The code in the repo was created by watching stuff from this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhTaENzfZQ) by TailwindCSS's author Adam just to get the gist of how Tailwind CSS works.

This will be now used just as a playground repo to try out different things using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).
